# QuantumCellularAutomaton
This is the code and video repository for my MSc dissertation project, 'The Quantum Cellular Automaton'. A customized Quantum Coin is used to produce a novel Quantum Walk along a number line in 1D space.

The code is split into two files, MainWalk and SecondaryAnalysis.

MainWalk contains the bulk of the actual processing used in the Quantum Walk, with a few user options and some customizability for experimentation. It produces a sample of graphs if displayOutput=True, and will save them to local directories if saveOutput=True

SecondaryAnalysis produces a small number of additional graphs, dealing with relativistic physics.


## Videos
A small number of short videos are presented in /videos demonstrating the diffusion effects of the Quantum Walk for a curated selection of different cases.
